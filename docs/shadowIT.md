# ☁️ Shadow IT: The Hidden Risks Lurking in Your Network

## **Introduction**
Ah, **Shadow IT**—the bane of every security team’s existence. You lock down everything, enforce strict policies, and yet, someone in marketing *still* decides to spin up a **Dropbox account** to “make collaboration easier.” Congratulations, your data is now one misconfiguration away from public exposure. 🎉

Today, we’ll cover:
1. **What Shadow IT is** and why it’s a nightmare.
2. **How attackers exploit it** during a penetration test.
3. **A real-world example** of an actual breach caused by unauthorized services.
4. **How to hunt for Shadow IT in your own network** before the bad guys do.

## **What is Shadow IT?**
Shadow IT refers to **unauthorized hardware, software, or cloud services** used by employees without the approval (or knowledge) of the IT department. Examples include:
- Personal **Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive** accounts.
- Employees running **unauthorized web servers** on company hardware.
- Using **third-party email services** to bypass company filters.
- Self-hosted **VPNs or proxies** for unrestricted internet access.

🚨 **Why is this a problem?** 🚨
- **Data Loss & Exposure** – Unsecured storage can leak sensitive information.
- **No Security Patching** – IT teams can’t protect what they don’t know exists.
- **Regulatory Compliance Violations** – Data stored outside approved environments can get companies fined.

## **How Attackers Exploit Shadow IT**
From a pentester’s perspective, Shadow IT is **free real estate**. If an employee deploys an unauthorized system, odds are:
1. **It has weak authentication** (or none at all).
2. **It’s not being monitored.**
3. **It exposes internal services to the internet.**

During a pentest, here’s what we look for:
- **Cloud storage leaks**: Employees syncing company data to personal Dropbox or Google Drive accounts.
- **Unauthorized web servers**: We find forgotten **Jenkins, phpMyAdmin, or Nextcloud** instances running on high-numbered ports.
- **Exposed development environments**: Test servers often **run outdated software** and have **default credentials.**

## **Real-World Example: Shadow IT in Action**
A **financial institution** we assessed had a strict **no-cloud-storage policy.** Except, as it turns out, that policy didn’t stop a department from using **a personal OneDrive account** to share sensitive Excel spreadsheets.

### **What we found:**
- One employee used their **personal email** to create a **OneDrive account**.
- A script automatically synced **customer data** to OneDrive every night.
- The account had **no multi-factor authentication (MFA).**
- The credentials were **leaked in a previous data breach** (thanks, HaveIBeenPwned).

### **Result?**
- Attackers accessed **customer financial records** via the exposed OneDrive.
- The company suffered **regulatory fines and legal action.**

## **How to Detect & Eliminate Shadow IT**
Want to stay ahead of the game? **Here’s how to hunt for rogue IT services:**

🔍 **Monitor Outbound Traffic**
- Use **firewall rules** to detect connections to unauthorized cloud services.
- Look for **DNS requests** to file-sharing platforms.

🔍 **Conduct Regular Asset Discovery**
- Use **nmap, Shodan, or internal scans** to find unapproved services.
- Regularly audit **cloud service usage** via Microsoft 365, AWS, or Google Workspace logs.

🔍 **Educate Employees**
- **Explain why Shadow IT is risky.** If users know *why* it's dangerous, they might stop doing it (wishful thinking, but still).
- Provide **approved alternatives** that are **secure and user-friendly.**

## **Conclusion**
Shadow IT isn’t just a minor inconvenience—it’s a massive security risk. Unauthorized services **bypass security controls**, **expose sensitive data**, and **make incident response nearly impossible.**

Want to keep your network secure? **Find and eliminate Shadow IT before attackers do.** Because nothing says “I care about security” like *not* letting employees run their own rogue IT department. 😉
