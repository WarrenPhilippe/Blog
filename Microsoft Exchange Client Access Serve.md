# Microsoft Exchange Client Access Server Information Disclosure: The "Oops, Hereâ€™s My Internal IP" Bug

## The Scene: An External Pentest Gone Too Well
Ah, Microsoft Exchangeâ€”the gift that keeps on giving. During an external penetration test, I stumbled upon an information disclosure bug that made recon a breeze. Instead of sweating over OSINT and pivoting through obscure DNS leaks, the Exchange Client Access Server (CAS) decided to just *hand me* its internal IP like a confused mall security guard giving out the WiFi password.

## The Setup: IIS 10.0, HTTP/1.0, and a Misconfigured Host Header
The server was running **IIS 10.0**, and I found that if you send a good olâ€™ **HTTP/1.0** request while supplying an **empty Host header**, the response would include some juicy internal informationâ€”specifically, the private IP address of the server, neatly tucked away in the **WWW-Authenticate realm header**.

## The "Elite" Exploit (a.k.a. Running Curl)
This is one of those exploits where you donâ€™t need a fancy zero-day or an obscure Python script. Nope, just some good old **curl**:

```bash
curl -X GET http://target.com/owa/ -H "Host:" --http1.0 -i
```

### Expected Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate
WWW-Authenticate: NTLM realm="192.168.1.50"
```

Oh no, Exchange! You werenâ€™t supposed to **tell me that!**

## Why This Works: Exchange + IIS Being "Helpful"
By default, Exchange CAS servers running on **IIS 10.0** love to respond to authentication requests in a way that includes the internal realm. Normally, this isnâ€™t an issueâ€”unless, of course, someone forgot to properly configure the headers and now **every unauthenticated request leaks the internal network structure**.

And letâ€™s be honest: most admins are too busy fighting Outlook issues to bother with security headers.

## The "Why Should You Care?" Section
What can an attacker do with an internal IP? Well, for starters:
- **Refine attack paths:** Knowing the internal structure makes pivoting much easier.
- **Bypass some poorly configured security policies:** If there's a split-tunnel VPN or weak firewall rules, this can be gold.
- **Social engineering fuel:** "Oh hey, IT helpdesk? Yeah, Iâ€™m calling from 192.168.1.50, we got a problem..." *NGL, I lacked some inspiration on that one*

## How to Fix This (If Youâ€™re an Admin and Now Panicking)
Luckily, this oneâ€™s an easy fix (assuming you donâ€™t ignore it like that pile of pending updates on your test server):

1. **Disable NTLM authentication over HTTP (force it over HTTPS)**
2. **Set up proper response headers to avoid leaking internal details**
3. **Use a reverse proxy or WAF to filter and block HTTP/1.0 requests**
4. **Audit Exchange CAS configurations (because this probably isnâ€™t the only issue)**

## Final Thoughts
Itâ€™s 2025, and Microsoft Exchange is *still* finding new ways to embarrass itself. But hey, if youâ€™re a pentester, itâ€™s free recon with minimal effortâ€”so thanks, Exchange, for making external engagements just a little bit easier. ðŸŽ‰
